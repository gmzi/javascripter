# DOM manipulation

Once we selected the HTMLElements, we do something with them.

- Modify text inside an HTMLElement
- change inline styling
- modify atributes (src, href, class, id, type, value)
- Traverse, create, append and remove elements from the DOM.

## innerText

Affects text only (no tags, no style). For single content with no nested elements (would mess up changing nested tags and multiple elements with one single string). Whatever is added will be treated as text only.

```html
<h1>Old text<h1></h1></h1>
```

```javascript
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1"); // Old text
h1.innerText = "new texto"; // new texto
const caps = h1.innerText.toUpperCase();
h1.innerText = caps; // NEW TEXTO
```

## textContent

It's a bit dumber than innerText, Converts tags and CSS into text, and is unaware about what's hidden and what's showed in the CSS styling.

```javascript
h1.textContent; // NEW TEXTO;
h1.textContent = "changed again"; // changed again;
```

## innerHTML

Affects text and tags.

Read the content:

```javascript
const list = document.querySelector(".craigs-list.first ol");
list.innerHTML;
/* 
<li>craig 1</li>
<li>craig 2</li>
*/
```

Modify the content:

```javascript
list.innerHTML += "<li class='new-item'>New item</li>";
list.innerHTML; /*
<li>craig 1</li>
<li>craig 2</li>
<li class="new-item">New item</li> */
```

NOTE: innerHTML will treat added values as HTML, so users could enter scripts that would be runned in our site, so be careful with this. A Cross Site Scripting Attack consists in injecting js scripts in our code with bad intentions. Browsers have protections for this, but still is possible to insert scripts if the code is not sanitized (innerText does sanitize the code added, so it's safer).
